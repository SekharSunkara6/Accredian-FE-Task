# Refer & Earn Accredian-FE task

This project is designed to Create a captivating and responsive user interface for the refer & earn landing page using React js. The UI should be visually appealing, intuitive, and include a "Refer Now" button that triggers a popup modal with referral form for referring a course.

## Features

### Refer & Earn Landing Page

- **Hero Section**: Our landing page features a stunning hero section that immediately captures the user's attention. It includes a prominent "Refer Now" button, which, when clicked, triggers a popup modal where users can fill out the referral form.

### Popup Modal

- **Referral Form**: The popup modal contains a referral form designed to capture all necessary details about the referrer and the referee. The form fields include:
  - Referrer's Name
  - Referrer's Email
  - Referee's Name
  - Referee's Email
  - Course to Refer
  - Additional Comments (optional)

### Design Considerations

- **Styling with Material-UI/Tailwind CSS**: We've utilized Material-UI/Tailwind CSS to build our components, ensuring a modern and visually appealing design that's both responsive and engaging.
- **Form Validation**: Mandatory fields in the referral form are validated to ensure that all necessary information is provided before submission. This ensures a smooth and error-free process for users participating in the refer & earn program.
